# magnolia weather

A minimalist, film-inspired weather experience that treats weather as **atmosphere**, not data.

This project transforms real-time weather and local time into slow, contemplative cinematic scenes. Each city becomes a moment. Each update feels like a cut, not a refresh.


This project is heavily influenced by the visual language and emotional pacing of **Magnolia**.

Not in narrative, but in **tone**:

* Overcast skies as emotional weight
* Quiet transitions rather than dramatic cuts
* Stillness that feels intentional, not empty
* Weather as subtext, not spectacle


The rain in *Magnolia* is not just rain.
In the same way, weather here is not just information. It is context.


## Key Features

### Local City Time

* Displays the city’s **actual local time** at the top
* Subtle, letter-spaced, unobtrusive
* Reinforces realism without breaking immersion

### Cinematic Weather States

Weather is mapped into emotional buckets:

* Clear
* Cloudy
* Rainy

Each combined with:

* Morning
* Afternoon
* Evening
* Night

This creates scene variations that feel intentional rather than literal.

### Caption-as-Dialogue

Captions behave like scene notes or quiet narration.
They fade in after the image settles, never competing for attention.

### Film Grain & Vignette

* Grain appears primarily at night
* Vignette subtly frames the scene
* Effects are restrained to avoid stylization fatigue

### Random City Mode

A deliberate design choice.
Instead of control, you can drift.

This mirrors cinema’s relationship with place:
you arrive somewhere without choosing it.
